======================================

This is an attempt a migrating an unorganized SVN repo to git in order to:
>Make it so my grandmother could use it.

Sources
-------------------------------------
The project sources can be found in the srcs directory. Each sub-project will have it's own directory wherein the source code related to that project and any project files are stored. SVN like folders such as trunk, branch, and tag have been removed in favor of git constructs that do not complicate the repo in the way svn does. Tagging is also much cleaner in git.

Currently the srcs folder has the following projects:
>My EasyVeep

Documents
------------------------------------
Documents will be stored in the docs folder.
Currently the docs folder has:
> Development Logs (notes taken while developing software)


README will be updated as commits are made
