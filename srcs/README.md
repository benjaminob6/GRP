Software Sources
=======================

This directory contains all software and firmware sources. For details on each individual project, check the README in that project's sub directory. Desktop projects will typically be in a Visual Studio 2010 project, while firmware projects will either be in TICCS5 project directories or possibly GNU Linux style directories. Project descriptions follow.

MyEasyVeep
-------------------
When debugging issues with festo-didactic EasyVeep caused the project to go south, the swf files were extracted from the original EasyVeep software and this new piece of software was created to provide a clean, debug-able interface more suitable for the project needs.
