MYEasyVeep
======================
MyEasyVeep was created to easy the difficulty of working with the rather ancient, Adobe Authorware 7 EasyVeep binaries. The project is written in C# on the .NET 3.5 Framework. 

The project is basically a wrapper around the .swf objects provided by EasyVeep as process simulations. Eventually it will be a fully multi-threaded software project capable of interacting over a USB link with a micro-controller where it will marshal input/output changes between the .swfs and the attached micro-controller.
