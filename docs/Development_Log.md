**DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL**

This file will eventually act as a daily journal of sorts detailing what
was done during a work session. It will include any relevant information
that cannot be directly assumed through common sense. Details of
implementation, design, and problems encountered will be logged as well.
Currently the file is rather sparse due to disorganization up this
point. Future updates will be logged into this file as necessary and
will hopefully allow for copy-paste when it comes time to write the GRP
report.

**Problems with EasyVeep and a Custom EasyVeep Implementation**

The purpose of this project is to allow physical real time targets to
interact with virtual process simulations. EasyVeep was selected
primarily based on easy of acquisition, but it was found that
interacting with EasyVeep was more challenging than initially expected.
One of the main issues with EasyVeep was its use of ASCII based
communication instead of binary communication. This increased serial
utilization, and given the control words and baud rates used by EasyVeep
it is impossible to achieve latency times of less than 10ms turn around,
and even then, that refresh rate could only be maintained for a very
short burst.

It was discovered that each of the EasyVeep process simulations were
completely encapsulated in their own, independent swf files. A quick
Google searched revealed that the Adobe Flash ActiveX control could be
easily added to a Visual Studio project. Seeing that minimal effort was
needed to run the swf files in a custom Windows application it was
decided that to easy debugging and protocol implementation a custom
version of EasyVeep should be created. This allowed for full control
over serial parameters and protocol.

The swf files were still a black box with no fields publicly exposed in
plain text. To allow interfacing with the process simulations, a trial
version of the Sothink SWF Decompiler was downloaded and used to analyze
the Actionscript code. This allowed for important variable names to be
extracted so that they could be read and modified by the custom EasyVeep
implementation. Some important variable names are as follows:

| Variable Name | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
|EprgName| English Program Name|
|EprgLeirasX| English Program Description ( X = 0..10)|
|EDigSensX|  English Sensor Description ( X = 1..16)|
|EDigActX| English Actuator Description (X = 1..16)|
|DAX Digital| Actuator Value ( X =1..16)|
|DSX Digital| Sensor Value (X=1..16)|
|ASX Analog| Sensor Value ( X=1..16)|

These variables can be accessed in the using the GetVariable and
SetVariable functions of the Flash ActiveX Control. For example, finding
all the sensors associated with a process model can be performed as
followed after the model is loaded.


```csharp
do{
        SensorDescription = axFlash.GetVariable(String.Format("EDigSens{0}", SensorDescriptionIndex));

        if ( SensorDescription != "" )
                movieInfo.Sensors[SensorDescriptionIndex-1] = 
                        new DigitalSensor( SensorDescription, SensorDescriptionIndex);
        
        SensorDescriptionIndex++;
        
} while (SensorDescription != "" && SensorDescriptionIndex <= 16);
```

There does not appear to be any event that fires as the sensor values
change, so as a result, the sensor values have to be polled constantly
to determine when a change has occurred. More development to followâ€¦
Primary concern is falling over to a digital input/output when the
simulation supports analog values. This will require a bit more testing
to figure out the best way.

Primary goals:

- [x] Move to github
- [x] Clean up source codes/refactor
- [x] Continue implementation on MyEasyVeep

A repository was created on github in order to replace the confusing,
overly verbose SVN repository that was being used. Github was selected
due to its standing in the open source community and its excellent user
interface that makes documenting and browsing code much easier than the
Assembla interface. The code is currently hosted in a publicly visible
repository that is available for read only access at
[https://github.com/benjaminob6/GRP](https://github.com/benjaminob6/GRP).

The migration process is rather slow going as cleanup is being performed
and README.md are being added where necessary. One of the benefits of
the Github interface is the Markdown Render that automatically displays
any README.md files that may be in the viewing directory. This allows
for the inclusion of nicely formatted descriptions, hyperlinks, and even
pictures; things which were not possible with the SVN repository. As of
the writing of this note (11:22AM) only the MyEasyVeep application
source has been uploaded, but the READMEs have improved navigation and
documentation considerably with minimal effort.

Minimal documentation of the HW has made it to Github.

More analysis was done of the target swfs using flasm. Details can be
found in flasm.md on Github. The overall summary is that there are no
models requiring more than 12 pins in either direction and that there
are no models requiring analog interfaces. Therefore, all models should
be able to interface with a Stellaris chip if the choice is made to go
in that direction. Details of inputs and outputs for each model have been
included in flasm.md. It was found that directly modifying DS[0-16] or DA[0-16]
would effect the Sensors and Actuators of the simulation, repsectively.

With knowledge about the structure of the swfs, it should be possible to
create new ones easily enough, but research into that is being put off until
more progress is made on the main work products.

Implementation of the MyEasyVeep Sensor Update routine has been roughly hashed out. A C# form timer is being used to check the status from the swf every 67ms (the swfs were found to update at a rate of 15fps thus $\frac{1}{15} = 0.6666 $). Status is promising but one swf does not take kindly to the constant polling. Further research is necessary as to why the 7-seg simulation is so picky.
