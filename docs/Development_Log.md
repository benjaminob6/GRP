**DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL**

This file will eventually act as a daily journal of sorts detailing what
was done during a work session. It will include any relevant information
that cannot be directly assumed through common sense. Details of
implementation, design, and problems encountered will be logged as well.
Currently the file is rather sparse due to disorganization up this
point. Future updates will be logged into this file as necessary and
will hopefully allow for copy-paste when it comes time to write the GRP
report.

**Problems with EasyVeep and a Custom EasyVeep Implementation**

The purpose of this project is to allow physical real time targets to
interact with virtual process simulations. EasyVeep was selected
primarily based on easy of acquisition, but it was found that
interacting with EasyVeep was more challenging than initially expected.
One of the main issues with EasyVeep was its use of ASCII based
communication instead of binary communication. This increased serial
utilization, and given the control words and baud rates used by EasyVeep
it is impossible to achieve latency times of less than 10ms turn around,
and even then, that refresh rate could only be maintained for a very
short burst.

It was discovered that each of the EasyVeep process simulations were
completely encapsulated in their own, independent swf files. A quick
Google searched revealed that the Adobe Flash ActiveX control could be
easily added to a Visual Studio project. Seeing that minimal effort was
needed to run the swf files in a custom Windows application it was
decided that to easy debugging and protocol implementation a custom
version of EasyVeep should be created. This allowed for full control
over serial parameters and protocol.

The swf files were still a black box with no fields publicly exposed in
plain text. To allow interfacing with the process simulations, a trial
version of the Sothink SWF Decompiler was downloaded and used to analyze
the Actionscript code. This allowed for important variable names to be
extracted so that they could be read and modified by the custom EasyVeep
implementation. Some important variable names are as follows:

| Variable Name | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
|EprgName| English Program Name|
|EprgLeirasX| English Program Description ( X = 0..10)|
|EDigSensX|  English Sensor Description ( X = 1..16)|
|EDigActX| English Actuator Description (X = 1..16)|
|DAX Digital| Actuator Value ( X =1..16)|
|DSX Digital| Sensor Value (X=1..16)|
|ASX Analog| Sensor Value ( X=1..16)|

These variables can be accessed in the using the GetVariable and
SetVariable functions of the Flash ActiveX Control. For example, finding
all the sensors associated with a process model can be performed as
followed after the model is loaded.


```csharp
do{
        SensorDescription = axFlash.GetVariable(String.Format("EDigSens{0}", SensorDescriptionIndex));

        if ( SensorDescription != "" )
                movieInfo.Sensors[SensorDescriptionIndex-1] = 
                        new DigitalSensor( SensorDescription, SensorDescriptionIndex);
        
        SensorDescriptionIndex++;
        
} while (SensorDescription != "" && SensorDescriptionIndex <= 16);
```

There does not appear to be any event that fires as the sensor values
change, so as a result, the sensor values have to be polled constantly
to determine when a change has occurred. More development to followâ€¦
Primary concern is falling over to a digital input/output when the
simulation supports analog values. This will require a bit more testing
to figure out the best way.

----------------------------

Primary goals:

- [x] Move to github
- [x] Clean up source codes/refactor
- [x] Continue implementation on MyEasyVeep

A repository was created on github in order to replace the confusing,
overly verbose SVN repository that was being used. Github was selected
due to its standing in the open source community and its excellent user
interface that makes documenting and browsing code much easier than the
Assembla interface. The code is currently hosted in a publicly visible
repository that is available for read only access at
[https://github.com/benjaminob6/GRP](https://github.com/benjaminob6/GRP).

The migration process is rather slow going as cleanup is being performed
and README.md are being added where necessary. One of the benefits of
the Github interface is the Markdown Render that automatically displays
any README.md files that may be in the viewing directory. This allows
for the inclusion of nicely formatted descriptions, hyperlinks, and even
pictures; things which were not possible with the SVN repository. As of
the writing of this note (11:22AM) only the MyEasyVeep application
source has been uploaded, but the READMEs have improved navigation and
documentation considerably with minimal effort.

Minimal documentation of the HW has made it to Github.

More analysis was done of the target swfs using flasm. Details can be
found in flasm.md on Github. The overall summary is that there are no
models requiring more than 12 pins in either direction and that there
are no models requiring analog interfaces. Therefore, all models should
be able to interface with a Stellaris chip if the choice is made to go
in that direction. Details of inputs and outputs for each model have been
included in flasm.md. It was found that directly modifying DS[0-16] or DA[0-16]
would effect the Sensors and Actuators of the simulation, respectively.

With knowledge about the structure of the swfs, it should be possible to
create new ones easily enough, but research into that is being put off until
more progress is made on the main work products.

Implementation of the MyEasyVeep Sensor Update routine has been roughly hashed out. A C# form timer is being used to check the status from the swf every 67ms (the swfs were found to update at a rate of 15fps thus $\frac{1}{15} = 0.6666 $). Status is promising but one swf does not take kindly to the constant polling. Further research is necessary as to why the 7-seg simulation is so picky.

March 15, 2013
-------------------------------------

Primary Goals:

- [x] Get all simulations running nicely with custom EasyVeep (Except 7-seg)
- [x] Do some more refactoring to improve maintainability
- [x] Make it prettier
- [ ] Hash out serial coms
- [x] Add menu bar and option items to application

Models for the DigitalSensor and DigitalActuators and other Process related
classes were moved into a new subdirectory and proper constructor and accessors
methods were added so that depance on array indexes could almost be completely
eliminated. Getting, Setting, and Toggeling values is now nicely encapsulated
for both sensors and actuators.

The discovery of the "auto" variable in the swf files made many of the swfs usable
after a SetVariable call was put in to turn auto to 0. May swfs would turn auto on
making it impossible to actually interact with the swf via external means. Each swf
seemed to set auto a different times, so a brute force approach is currently being used
to constantly set auto to 0 to allow the simulations to be useful.

Another deficiency of the EasyVeep swfs was found. Apparently some do not properly initialize
the values for the Sensors and Actuators, which leads to Exceptions being thrown if 
the program attempts to read those values. To fix this, at least for Actuators, MyEasyVeep
initializes all Actuator values to 0 as soon as possible so that later it can query the
values when performing and insuring bit toggles go through. Still no hope on getting 7-Seg
to cooperate.

Ugly form buttons have been replaced with circular png graphics in the same vein as
those found in EasyVeep visuals. Each one is associated with an input and output and
are sort of encapsulated nicely so that redrawing occurs auto magically.

Redacting previous statement: Setting sensor values to 0 as soon as movie loads resolves
all exception issues when attempting to read sensor values. 7-Seg is a go.

A menu bar has been added that allows the user to toggle Auto mode on and off
if they wish to view how the simulation is supposed to operate. Additionally,
an area has been set up in the menu bar to allow selection and configuation 
of a serial device. It is planned to make this operate similar to the Arduino
enviornment for selecting serial devices.

March 22, 2013
----------------------------------

Primary Goals:

- [x] Evaluate Si Isolator Circuits
- [x] Formalize report layout
- [ ] Continue work on Serial Comms

Dispite terrible solder joints, the Si isolator IC's appear to be working fine. The formal report layout was made and uploaded to Blackboard for review. Serial comms are still lagging due to indecision.


March 24, 2013
----------------------------------

Primary Goals:

- [X] Get the Valueline discovery board working
- [ ] Serial Coms?

[This document](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~geobrown/book.pdf) was used to set up a good dev enviornment for the STM32VLDISCOVERY. All other documented toolchains were rather limited or expensive, so a GNU/Linux based solution was used. The steps detailed in the text were used to set up a valid enviornment and an example project was cloned to easy the startup. The necessary paths were updated to match the system on which development was occurring.

This introduced the use of gdb and stlink-hexane to perform various debugging and uploading tasks. Results so far are in line with what is presented in the document.


March 27, 2013
-----------------------------------

Primary Goals:
- [x] Switch back to the Stellaris
- [X] Get all 16 Inputs and Outputs working
- [X] Establish Serial Connection With MCU
- [X] Test Isolator Bank
- [ ] Implement Serial Protocol

After attempting to get the STM32VLDISCOVERY VCP working for a couple of days to no avail, the processor has been abandoned. Work began on the Stellaris platform. Using the PinMux utility to generate the GPIO configuration automatically, the number of available pins increased. (Some were protected function by the processor and required special instructions to access. These are what PinMux generated).

Development on the Stellaris went smoothly. Using LEDs and an Arduino it was possible to validate the the routines for reading and writting the Sensor and Actuator values. Full 16 In, 16 Out has been achieved.

A few of the Si Isolator units were tested with the Stellaris driving them at 3.3V and the Arudino at 5V. Results are promissing and the full amount required should fit well within the power budget.

Time ran long trying to figure out how to build a flash image for the Stellaris, so the serial protocol code has yet to be implemented. This needs to happen ASAP, so tomorrow is probably the day I can finally check off 'Hash out serial comms'.

After that, it is a matter of finializing the circuit layout and placing it on a protoboard instead of breadboard. I attempted to make the cables necessary for the Arcom to connect, but failed to acquire the wire strippers before the hardware store closed.
